I couldn't even think about putting it down and if I had to then all I could think about was getting back to it. Honestly I was quite content and happy with how If I Stay ended. It was an epic ending if you ask me. But of course if Gayle Forman is going to offer more of Adam and Mia's story, then I'm going to take it. And I did and loved it. It crushed me and then made me whole again.It was very hard for me to not flip to the end to see how this story was going to conclude but I kept control and just moved forward with the story. It was just that I really didn't know how this was going to end and it was ripping me apart. This year I've read some books with unhappy endings and have actually enjoyed them, kind of like a breath of fresh-air, something different, but there's no way I could have handled an ending like that with this book.I fell in love with Gayle Forman's writing and am looking forward to reading her other books!\n"
